// CREATED A VIRTUAL VOICE ASSISTANT SIMILAR TO ALXEA. 
//Instead of "Alexa" i have used here "ChatBot".
//Libraries used here are :-
//speech_recognition
//pyttsx3
//pywhatkit
//wikipedia
//pyjokes

//Code:-
import speech_recognition as speech
import pyttsx3         # python text to speech
import pywhatkit
import datetime
import wikipedia
import pyjokes
listener = speech.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)


def talk(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()


def take_command():
    try:
        with speech.Microphone() as source:
            print('listening...')
            voice = listener.listen(source)
            command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
            command = command.lower()
            if 'chatbot' in command:
                command = command.replace('chatbot', '')
                print(command)
    except:
        print("microphone not working")
    return command


def run_chatbot():
    command = take_command()
    print(command)
    if 'play' in command:
        song = command.replace('play', '')
        talk('playing ' + song)
        pywhatkit.playonyt(song)
    elif 'time' in command:
        time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p')
        talk('Current time is ' + time)
    elif 'who' in command:
        person = command.replace('who', '')
        info = wikipedia.summary(person, 1)
        print(info)
        talk(info)
    elif 'date' in command:
        talk('sorry, I have a headache')
    elif 'are you single' in command:
        talk('I am in a relationship with wifi')
    elif 'joke' in command:
        talk(pyjokes.get_joke())
    else:
        talk('Please say the command again.')
while True:
    run_chatbot()
